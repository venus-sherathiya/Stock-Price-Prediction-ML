# Stock-Price-Prediction-ML

This is my Machine Learning Project. The main aim of the project is to predict stock price of a particular company 
based on the data collected for that particular company.

# Overview of Project and its Implementation

In this project, data of APPLE company stock is taken from "YAHOO" database and the machine learning model is build using the
same data and LSTM network.

All the information regarding the LSTM and how data is collected and cleaned can be found at
[Stock_price_prediction_using_LSTM.ipynb](https://github.com/venus-sherathiya/Stock-Price-Prediction-ML/blob/master/Stock_price_prediction_using_LSTM.ipynb)

The plot for actual and predicted values is as follows
